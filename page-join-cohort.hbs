            <h2>What this looks like</h2>

            <p>
            You and others active citizens like you spend time learning about how civic systems actually work. It’s not the civics textbook version, the real version. How ward budgets are allocated, how to read a master plan, who has the power, and how to engage with them effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
            Cohorts can meet online or offline.You may do some reading, but mostly, you’ll be talking, learning from each other and workshopping ideas together.
