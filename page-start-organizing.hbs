            <p>
            If you want to make small, local changes in your community, the kind of organising that doesn’t make the headlines, but changes how a place works: we’re here to help!
            </p>

            <p>
            We’re not going to tell you what issue to organise around. You know your neighbourhood better than we do. But we can help you figure out how. Where to start, who to talk to, what’s actually going to be worth your time.
