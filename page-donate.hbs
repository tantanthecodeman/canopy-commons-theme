            A healthy local democracy in practice is one where citizens know and can easily reach local decision-makers, where consultations and civic forums are regular, meaningful and engaging, where women and vulnerable groups participate confidently, where local authorities are responsive, and where communities feel a sense of agency and ownership over their environment and communities.

              <h2>We’re working towards:</h2>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Area Sabhas or Ward Meetings that actually function.</li>
                <li>Civic curricula that are taught in neighbourhoods, not just conferences.</li>
                <li>Tools and frameworks that organisers can use without having to reinvent the wheel every time.</li>

    <!-- WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION SUPPORTS -->

        <div class="container narrow">
            
              <h2>What your contribution supports:</h2>

            <p>
            When you donate to Canopy Commons, you’re funding the unglamorous work that makes everything else possible.
            </p>

            <p>
            You’re paying for the person who shows up to the same Ward meeting every time, even when nothing exciting happens. Support for citizens and volunteers who spend weeks mapping out how civic decisions are actually made in tier-2 cities. You’re funding the building of tools organisers can use in cities like Pune or Patna.
            </p>

            <p>
            You’re also funding learning. Figuring out what works, what doesn’t, what needs adaptation. And paying for the mistakes we’ll make along the way.

    <!-- WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS -->
    <section class="donate-section-block blue-section">
        <div class="container narrow">

            <h2>What we’re working towards:</h2>

            <p>
            We will operate proactively rather than reactively to anticipate challenges (around climate change, gender, and other intersections) and create scalable models of civic engagement. Amid a widening trust gap between citizens and authorities, we will build bridges of trust, transparency, and genuine accountability by working closely with authorities to respond effectively to citizen-led initiatives, and building narratives around the world we aspire to create.
            </p>

            <p>
            The kind of democracy we envision cannot be built on urgency alone and will require patience, trust and supporting communities to find their voice and power. We plan to help build civic infrastructure that is rooted in place, powered by people and designed for a thriving democracy.

    <!-- WHY INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS -->
    <section class="donate-section-block">
        <div class="container narrow">
            
              <h2>Why individual donations:</h2>

            <p>
            Individual donations gives us room to breathe. To say no to things that don’t fit. To support small ideas from communities even if it doesn’t neatly fit into our ‘strategy’.
            </p>

            <p>
            It also keeps us honest. When our funding comes from people whose cities we’re trying to change, it helps us stay rooted.

    <!-- HOW MUCH -->
    <section class="donate-section-block yellow-section">
        <div class="container narrow">

            <h2>How much and how often:</h2>

            <p>
            Whatever works for you. Rs.500 is meaningful, Rs.5000 once is meaningful. Some people do Rs.100 on the first of every month because it’s small enough that they don’t have to think about it, but it adds up.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you can commit to a recurring donation, we’d be grateful. It let’s us plan ahead.
