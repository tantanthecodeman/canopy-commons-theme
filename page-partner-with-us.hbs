            <p>
            Do you run and organisation already? Or a local collective? Or some civic work on ground? You don’t need us to tell you what to do, but we could offer some support.
            </p>

            <p>
            We partner with groups who share our belief that civic infrastructure is built over years. We work with those who are serious about staying local and accountable.
