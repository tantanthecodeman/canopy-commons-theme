                    Citizens want to engage in decisions around water, waste,
                    safety, public spaces or transport — but the pathways
                    to do so are confusing, exhausting and reactive.

                <h4>Momentum fades</h4>
                <p>
                    Civic action spikes during moments and fades soon after.
                    Participation is not designed to sustain itself.

                    Trust between citizens and authorities is fragile.
                    Meaningful civic infrastructure is often fragmented or missing.
