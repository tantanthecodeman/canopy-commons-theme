                Our current democratic systems often feel distant, transactional, and fragile.
                When communities lose the tools to talk to one another, local governance becomes
                a series of conflicts rather than a collaborative effort.

                In many cities, the spaces where people used to meet and organize have disappeared.
                Digital platforms often amplify division rather than consensus, leaving citizens
                feeling powerless to change their immediate surroundings.
