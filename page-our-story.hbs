                Participation shouldn’t feel exhausting. 
                It should feel possible.

                Canopy Commons exists because civic participation today feels harder than it needs to be.
                We believe democracy should be practiced, not appealed to.

            <h2>Democracy today often feels distant.</h2>

            <p>
                People are told to engage, to care, to speak up — but the actual process is confusing,
                exhausting, and often disappointing. You sign. You share. You wait. Nothing moves.
            </p>

            <p>
                Intent exists. What’s missing is access — to tools, to know-how, to examples of what
                actually works. Most citizens don’t know where power lives, how decisions are made,
                or how to meaningfully participate.

            <p>
                Trust is wearing thin. Digital-first campaigns feel hollow.
                People want engagement that feels human again — grounded in place,
                rooted in relationships, and capable of creating change.
