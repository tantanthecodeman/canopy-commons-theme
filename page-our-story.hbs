                Participation shouldn’t feel exhausting. 
                It should feel possible.

            <p>
                Canopy Commons exists because civic participation today feels harder than it needs to be.
                We believe democracy should be practiced, not appealed to.

            <h2>Democracy today often feels distant.</h2>

            <p>
                People are told to engage, to care, to speak up — but the actual process is confusing,
                exhausting, and often disappointing. You sign. You share. You wait. Nothing moves.
            </p>

            <p>
                Intent exists. What’s missing is access — to tools, to know-how, to examples of what
                actually works. Most citizens don’t know where power lives, how decisions are made,
                or how to meaningfully participate.

            <p>
                Trust is wearing thin. Digital-first campaigns feel hollow.
                People want engagement that feels human again — grounded in place,
                rooted in relationships, and capable of creating change.
