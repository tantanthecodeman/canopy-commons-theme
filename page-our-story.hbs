                    People are told to engage, to care, to speak up — but the actual process
                    of doing that is confusing, exhausting, and often disappointing.
                    Democracy has started to feel like something you appeal to,
                    not something you practice.

                <p>
                    Most citizens don’t know where they stand in the system,
                    who decides what, or how power really moves.
                    The distance between those who serve and those who are being served
                    keeps growing.

                    Digital-first campaigns feel hollow to many now.

                    grounded in place, rooted in relationships,
                    and capable of creating change.
